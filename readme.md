Tools that aid the declaration of domain glossaries

# purpose

make it easy to build reusable and enforceable glossaries

- declare the glossary of origin for domain objects
- enable type guards for primitive domain literals

# purpose^2

why use glossaries?

- interoperability
  - you can use the same definition of common dobjs across different projects and know they'll have the same implementation

- standardization
  - there's no risk of someone recreating the wheel if glossaries are leveraged; development becomes consolidated

- ubiquity
  - glossaries define subsets of ubiquitous language that can be leveraged
  - clear definitions and approved terms to eliminate ambiguity

# install

```sh
npm install domain-glossaries

glossary vs dictionary
> A glossary is a collection of words pertaining to a specific topic. In your thesis or dissertation, it's a list of all terms you used that may not immediately be obvious to your reader. In contrast, dictionaries are more general collections of words.
